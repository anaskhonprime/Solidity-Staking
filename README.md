# NftStaking
Staking the NFTs is a way to put your unique token to work on the blockchain. Even though staking NFTs is a relatively new concept, many NFT holders are very excited about this development. That is because a nonfungible token is unique, making holders reluctant to sell. This is the big difference with cryptocurrencies, where you can easily buy and sell crypto. To stake NFTs, you need a crypto wallet, which must be suitable for the NFT in question.The type of staking rewards that NFT holders can receive for deploying their NFTs depends on the platform and the type of NFT. Most NFT staking platforms offer periodic rewards, which are often paid out daily or weekly. Often, these rewards are paid out in the platform's utility token, but there are exceptions. Regardless of the token used for staking rewards, you can trade the staking reward tokens and possibly convert them into other cryptocurrencies or fiat money.
